    <h1>Dear Mimi</h1>
    <p>
I’ve admired you quietly for a long time—
from a distance, without expectations, just with honesty and care.

When our paths crossed again, you were still stunning in the same effortless way.
Your smile still had that power to soften everything, like it was never trying to be anything more than itself.

But what stayed with me weren’t the obvious moments.
It was the small, almost forgettable ones—the kind you don’t realize you’re keeping until they settle somewhere deep.

When you were zoning out and I gently patted your head,
and you smiled and called me cute,
there was this sudden, unexpected warmth in my chest—
a quiet kilig that surprised me with how real it felt.

And when my social battery ran out,
when I felt myself growing small and withdrawn,
you still looked at me with kindness and called me cute instead of awkward.
In that moment, I felt seen—not examined, not judged—just understood.
Safe, in a way that didn’t ask me to perform or explain myself.

There’s a warmth about you that’s hard to name.
A calm that settles into a space and makes everything feel lighter.
Being around you feels easy, like there’s nothing I have to prove and nowhere I need to rush to become.

Being drawn to you feels like holding a first edition of a book I never thought I’d be allowed to touch.
Not something to flip through, but something to approach with care.
I find myself moving slowly, breathing with each page, noticing every detail—the quiet strength in how it’s held together, the way time has shaped it without diminishing its beauty.
I take it in sentence by sentence, knowing some stories are too precious to be hurried.

That’s how my thoughts move toward you.
Not in a rush, not in a storm of feelings,
but with a steady, deliberate turning—
a quiet study of who you are, chapter by chapter.

I used to think loving someone was always a form of speaking—
of saying the right things, of making yourself known.
But with you, love feels more like listening.
Listening to the meaning in your silences,
to the truth in the way you say ordinary things,
to the history and possibility that live in the simple way you exist.

My admiration for you isn’t loud.
It doesn’t interrupt or demand to be noticed.
It’s the soft hum that stays with me through my days—
the constant awareness of a light that remains steady, even when you don’t realize how brightly you shine.
Without thinking, I find myself orienting toward that light, drawn by it in the most natural way.

There’s an ache in this feeling, but it isn’t painful.
It’s the ache of something that feels exactly right—
like a harmony settling into your bones.
It’s the quiet weight of caring so deeply it becomes part of your own atmosphere.
And I carry it not as a burden, but as a privilege.

I don’t love in bursts or grand declarations.
I love in the sustained note—
in the way my thoughts return to you like a familiar path, worn smooth by time and intention.
It’s a love that dwells, that lingers in the spaces between my thoughts, patient and unwavering—
like roots beneath the surface, unseen, yet strong enough to let everything else reach for the sky.

So this is my long, careful work:
the work of noticing you.
Of holding your presence gently in the quietest parts of myself.
Of weaving my admiration into something enduring and soft—
not to overwhelm, not to claim,
but simply to say: I see you.
I see the extraordinary in the ordinary way you exist.

I don’t know where this leads,
and I’m not asking for anything more than honesty.
I just wanted you to know that I like you—
quietly, sincerely, and with a full heart.

Not a moment.
Not an event.
But a climate.
A steady, gentle weather that has learned how to live in my soul.

With all my heart,
Aki
